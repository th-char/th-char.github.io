          Today we continue parsing the grammar that we defined in the previous tutorial, all that remains
          is the binary and unary expressions, but there is much, much more to them than immediately meets
          the eye. For example, we have to construct parsers that understand the idea of precedence and
          associativity. I've copied the grammar here for reference.

        <p>
          So now we're going to tackle a big parser. To motivate it, consider the equation <code>1 + 2 + 3</code>,
          we're going to say that addition is left associative, so we get <code>(1 + 2) + 3</code> which
          corresponds to the following AST
        </p>
        <pre>
      +
     / \
    +   3
   / \ 
  1   2</pre>
        <p>
          To understand what we have to do, let's think about it from a different way - consider instead if we
          tried to build this AST from the list <code>[Num 1, Num 2, Num 3]</code>. What we want here is to
          perform a <code>foldl1</code> - if you are not comfortable with folding over data structures,
          then consider a list <code>xs = [1, 2, 3, 4]</code> like
        </p>
        <pre>
    :
   / \ 
  1   :
     / \ 
    2   :
       / \ 
      3   :
         / \ 
        4  [] </pre>
        <p>
          Then <code>foldr f z xs</code> creates the function chain
        </p>
        <pre>
     f
    / \ 
   1   f 
      / \ 
     2   f 
        / \ 
       3   f 
          / \ 
         4   z  </pre>
        <p>
          So essentially what we are doing is applying a function <code>f</code> from the right of the list to the
          left and building up the final result from the intermediate results. Also, you could just see it as
        </p>
        <pre>
  f 1 (f 2 (f 3 (f 4 z)))
      </pre>
        <p>
          A <code>foldl</code> is very similar, except instead of going from right to left, it goes from left to right
          so the transformed tree would be
        </p>
        <pre>
          f 
         / \
        f   z
       / \
      f   4 
     / \  
    f   3
   / \ 
  1   2 </pre>
        <p>
          which of course is just like
        </p>
        <pre>
  f (f (f (f 1 2) 3) 4) z</pre>
        <p>
          <code>foldr1</code> and <code>foldl1</code> are very similar, except they use the element at the end of the
          list instead of another value <code>z</code>, we can define it with the identities
        </p>
        <pre>
  foldl1 f (x:xs) = foldl f x xs 
  foldr1 f xs     = foldr f (last xs) (init xs)</pre>
        <p>
          So now with this in mind, given the list <code>xs = [Num 1, Num 2, Num 3]</code>, we want
          <code>foldl1 Add xs</code> to get
        </p>
        <pre>
         Add
        /   \
      Add   Num 3
     /   \ 
  Num 1  Num 2</pre>
        <p>
          But how will we do this with our parsers? If we ignore the applicative context for a second, when we parse our
          string,
          we will get something like <code>Num 1, Add, Num 2, Add, Num 3</code>. First I will give a bit of a naive
          implementation,
          then a slightly better applicative implementation, and then I will introduce a much faster implementation that
          I was taught by Jamie Willis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, monadic computations are more intuitive to define than applicative, so let's start with that. This
          idea was
          inspired by <a href="https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.hs">this library</a>.
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainl1 :: Parser a -> Parser (a -> a -> a) -> Parser a
  chainl1 p op = do 
      x <- p 
      rest x 
    where 
      rest :: a -> Parser a
      rest x = rest' x <|> pure x

      rest' :: a -> Parser a
      rest' x = do 
        f <- op 
        y <- p 
        rest (f x y) </pre>
        <p>
          So essentially, what is happening is that we parse our first expression, then we use a helper function
          <code>rest</code> to
          cumulatively build the result in the accumulative parameter. It
          attempts to parse an operator and an argument, otherwise it just returns the result so far. <code>rest'</code>
          is responsible for
          actually trying to parse the next operator and argument and add that to its accumulative parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
          To really explicitly make the point, let us consider our <code>1+2+3</code> example, let
          <code>pAdd :: Parser Expr</code> consume a <code>+</code>
          and return an <code>BinOpExpr Add :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr</code> constructor. Let us consider how
          <code>chainl1 pNum pAdd</code> will execute on <code>"1+2+3"</code>
        </p>
        <pre>
  x               |  f  |  y  | Input   | Next function call 
                  |     |     | "1+2+3" |  x <- p 
  1               |     |     | "+2+3"  |  rest x, rest' x
  1               |     |     | "+2+3"  |  f <- op 
  1               | Add |     | "2+3"   |  y <- p
  1               | Add |  2  | "+3"    |  rest (f x y)
  Add 1 2         | Add |  2  | "+3"    |  rest' x
  Add 1 2         |     |     | "+3"    |  f <- op 
  Add 1 2         | Add |     | "3"     |  y <- p
  Add 1 2         | Add |  3  | ""      |  rest (f x y)
  Add (Add 1 2) 3 |     |     | ""      |  rest' x
  Add (Add 1 2) 3 |     |     | ""      |  pure x
      </pre>
        <p>
          Note that the final call to <code>rest' x</code> fails because it's unable to parse <code>pAdd</code> in the
          remaining
          (empty) input, so instead <code>rest x</code> returns <code>pure x</code> which will consume no more input and
          return <code>x</code> - exactly as we expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we prefer applicative style programming as it is prime for static analysis (I'll explain this in
          detail later).
          So let's try and create this function in an applicative style. The structure will be the same - i.e. it will
          be recursive,
          in the same way, but we must change the types for in to be applicative. So in the main function body, we are
          going to
          parse the first term and then feed this to our helper function (whose type is now different)
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainl1 :: Parser a -> Parser (a -> a -> a) -> Parser a
  chainl1 p op = p <**> rest
    where 
      rest :: Parser (a -> a)
      rest = ?

      rest' :: Parser (a -> a)
      rest' = ? </pre>
        <p>
          Here is another new operator <code><**> :: Parser (a -> a) -> Parser a -> Parser a</code>, it is essentially
          just
          <code><*></code> with the arguments reversed, so sequentially, we first parse the argument, then we pass the
          function and
          apply the function to the argument. For the definition of <code>rest</code>, we will still choose between
          either
          parsing another operator and term, or just returning - but this time we need functions of type
          <code>Parser (a -> a)</code>,
          the first one is just <code>rest'</code> because the types already match, but for the other one we cannot do
          <code>pure x</code> -
          we need some function that will return the accumulating parameter, but this is exactly what <code>id</code>
          is, so we have
        </p>
        <pre>
  rest = rest' <|> pure id </pre>
        <p>
          Next we need to work out a definition for <code>rest'</code>, we need to wrap a function that given a term,
          parses
          an operator and another term, and composes the operator and the terms in the correct order. First, let's try
          and parse an operator <code>Op</code>, then a term <code>t</code>, and then make a function of type
          <code>\x -> Op x t</code>,
          i.e. it places the term in the second argument of the constructor - fortunately, this is not too hard
        </p>
        <pre>
  (flip <$> op) <*> p</pre>
        <p>
          So first we parse an operator, then we flip the arguments, then parse a term and apply that to the operator,
          but
          because we have flipped the constructor arguments, the term is exactly where we want it to be. Now we need
          to work out how to recursively continue this. If we call <code>rest</code>, then we will get a
          <code>Parser (a -> a)</code>
          that performs <code>\x -> Op x t</code> or, in the base case, <code>id</code>. So if we ignore the applicative
          context
          for a second and consider the <code>1+2+3+4</code> example, we have a function that takes an x, a function
          <code>f</code>
          that
          parses <code>+2</code> to create <code>\x -> x+2</code>
          and a function <code>rest</code> that parses <code>+3+4</code> to create <code>\x -> (x+3)+4</code>, the way
          we want to compose these is
        </p>
        <pre>
  rest (f x) </pre>
        <p>
          to guarantee that we get <code>((1+2)+3)+4</code>, however, we dont have the luxury and writing our function
          in any
          way that we want, what we want to do is first parse with <code>f</code>, then <code>rest</code>, and then
          create the
          function <code>\x -> rest (f x)</code> - but all in an applicative context. Therefore what we want is
        </p>
        <pre>
  (\f r x -> r (f x)) <$> ((flip <$> op) <*> p) <*> rest</pre>
        <p>
          The lambda function first takes <code>f</code>, then <code>rest</code> and then composes them in the way
          we want. Seeing as <code>rest'</code> is only used in one place, we can simply inline it in <code>rest</code>,
          to get the final result
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainl1 p op = p <**> rest
    where 
      rest = ((\x' r x -> r (x' x)) 
               <$> ((flip <$> op) <*> p) <*> rest) 
             <|> pure id</pre>
        <p>
          Finally we can try this!
        </p>

          This definition was given to me by Jamie Willis, and I'll attempt to explain it here. The main idea is that
          instead of
          constructing our tree as we parse, we parse our tokens and then fold over the list of tokens to construct our
          tree.
          So firstly, how can we build our list of tokens ? We're going to use a similar trick to what we did with
          <code>sepBy1</code>,
          where we will parse one term, and then groups of an operator followed by a token, like
        </p>
        <pre>
  1   +2   +3   +4</pre>
        <p>
          This should follow quite easily from what we've done before, but there is a caveat, what we actually want is
          to partially
          construct our trees. In the previous examples, we constructed the function <code>\x -> Op x t</code> where
          <code>t</code>
          is some number we already know. Essentially what we are trying to build in the following
        </p>
        <pre>
        Add       Add       Add      
  1    /   \     /   \     /   \    
      _     2   _     3   _     4 </pre>
        <p>
          and then we can construct are tree by adding the left most subtreetree into the empty space in the next
          subtree. So the
          first question is how do we construct these partially applied trees. Let us not worry about the first token
          just yet,
          so then we essentially end up with a situation that we had before.
        </p>
        <pre>
  many (flip <$> op <*> p)</pre>
        <p>
          Now we have a list of functions, what we want to do is cummulatively apply them to our accumulating tree. To
          be really
          explict, this is what our accumulating tree would look like
        </p>
        <pre>
             Add         Add           Add      
        1   /   \       /   \         /   \    
           1     2     Add   3       Add   4            
                     /   \         /   \            
                    1     2      Add    3
                                /   \ 
                               1     2</pre>
        <p>
          We're clearly folding over the list from left to right, but if we look at the value of <code>foldl</code> we
          see
          it has type <code>(b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> [b]</code>. Clearly, our list <code>[a]</code> is the list
          of partial functions of type <code>Expr -> Expr</code> and <code>b</code> is our first term which
          has type <code>Expr</code>. Now we need some function that is going of type
          <code>Expr -> (Expr -> Expr) -> Expr</code>
          it is a bit sneaky, so I will tell you. Consider <code>($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b</code>, normally it is just
          use as a way of bracketing, but instead we could (for no good reason), write <code>($) f x</code> to apply
          <code>x</code>
          to <code>f</code>, but more interestingly, it we could do <code>(flip ($)) x f</code>, to flip the way we
          apply
          a function. We can see that <code>flip ($) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b</code>, which is exactly what we need ! So
          all we need to do is apply the <code>foldl (flip ($))</code> function in an applicative context and we get
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainl1 :: Parser a -> Parser (a -> a -> a) -> Parser a 
  chainl1 p op = foldl (flip ($)) 
                   <$> p 
                   <*> many (flip <$> op <*> p)</pre>
        <p>
          This definition is better for a few reasons, the most obvious one is that if we use <code>foldl'</code>
          instead,
          we get a very efficient function that is not achievable with the other definition.

          So <code>chainl1</code> with addition, but what do we do for something like <code>4^5^6</code> which should be 
          bracketed as <code>4^(5^6)</code>. Well this looks more like a fold from right to left.
        </p>
        <pre>
    ^     
   / \    
  4   ^   
     / \  
    5   6 
        </pre>
        <p>
          So first let's approach this monadically like we did with <code>chainl1</code>.
          First note that the right child of <code>4^5^6</code> is the tree formed by parsing 
          <code>5^6</code>. This is true for any right associative binary operator, so let's try 
          and use this to our advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we want to do is parse one number <code>x</code>, one operator <code>f</code>, then 
          build the right subtree of the expression (via recursion) <code>exp</code> and combine them 
          with <code>f x exp</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So our first attempt at creating this might be something like
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainr1 :: Parser a -> Parser (a -> a -> a) -> Parser a
  chainr1 p op = do 
    x <- p 
    f <- op 
    y <- chainr1 p op 
    return $ f x y</pre>
        <p>
          however, this does not actually work, for example:</p>
        <pre>
  > runParser (chainr1 pNum pExp) "1^2^3"
  Nothing
        </pre>
        <p>
          The reason this doesn't work is that eventually we are going to make a recursive call to 
          <code>chainr1</code> where the remaining string is just a term (in the previous example 
          we would eventually end up with <code>"3"</code>) and this does not contain an operator 
          as we would expect. Hence, we need to engineer <code>chainr1</code> a bit more carefully 
          so that it is able to parse a single term.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we have to extract the logic that begins by parse the operator and the expression that follows 
          the operator, so we do:
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainr1 :: Parser a -> Parser (a -> a -> a) -> Parser a
  chainr1 p op = do 
      x <- p 
      rest x 
    where
      rest x = do
        f <- op 
        y <- chainr1 p op 
        return $ f x y</pre>
        <p>
          This function still does not work, but now the problem is more localised, when we try to parse 
          a single term, then <code>x <- p</code> will be okay (it will just parse the term), but 
          <code>rest x</code> will fail as it tries to parse an operator, but there isn't one. In order 
          to fix this, we just use an alternative to account for when <code>rest x</code> fails - so 
          we get 
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainr1 :: Parser a -> Parser (a -> a -> a) -> Parser a
  chainr1 p op = do 
      x <- p 
      rest x <|> return x
    where
      rest x = do
        f <- op
        y <- chainr1 p op 
        return $ f x y</pre>
      </div>

          I think we've covered quite a lot in this, in the next tutorial, we will finish our grammar and introduce
          slightly more complex
          parsers. Feel free to let me know how you found this tutorial, I am always looking to improve the quality of
          this website.
