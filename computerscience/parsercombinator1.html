        <p>
          Before we start, I need to give a thank you. I would like to thank 
          Jamie Willis - a PhD student at Imperial College. He's very passionate about his study and 
          an extremely good teacher, most of what I know about parser combinators comes from him.

        <h5>The Idea</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          To start, we need to be confident on what a parser actually is. A parser should take some 
          string as an input, and return the parsed results. What the parsed result should look like 
          is a philosophical question and open to many opinions, generally though it is represented 
          as a tuple of what was parsed and what is remaining. The last thing to consider before we 
          see our first type is what if we fail to parse a certain input, then we need our type to 
          be able to represent that concept - there are two options for this, a list or a Maybe. My 
          personal opinion on this is that a list is more suitable when the computation is non-deterministic,
          meaning that we could get multiple results. To me it is not appropriate for our parsers to do this,
          hence a Maybe is more appropriate, it represents a successful parse or a failure to parse.
          What is our parsed result going to be, there are many options, so why don't we give ourselves 
          the ability to parse a string to any type a.
          Finally, we have a good idea of what we want:
        </p>
        <pre>
    newtype Parser a = Parser (String -> Maybe (a, String)) </pre>
        <p>
          We wrap our parser with the keyword Parser, primarily for type safety and also for readability. 
          However it would be a pain to always have to pattern match on this type, so let's make a 
          function that'll let us extract the function:
        </p>
        <pre>
    runParser :: Parser a -> (String -> Maybe (a, String))
    runParser (Parser p) = p</pre>
        <p>
          The point of this is we can now use a parser by saying "runParser p input". This isn't an 
          immediately obvious thing to do but it's a nice design pattern so I included it before 
          we start writing any parsers just to make all of our lives a bit easier. However, now we 
          are ready to create our first parser. We want to be able to parse a string, but let's start 
          small and parse a character. After all, "the man who moves mountains begins by carrying away 
          small stones" as Confucious once said.

        <h5>Parsing a Character</h5> 
      </div>

        <p>
          What should our little character parser look like. Well, we want to give it a character, and then 
          it create a parser for that exact character - nothing else. The standard way of naming parsers is
          to preppend a "p" to whatever the parser parses. So let's define the type for this thing.
        </p>
        <pre>
    pChar :: Char -> Parser Char</pre>
        <p>
          Hopefully the type is clear, for example "pChar 'a'" will parse the character 'a' and nothing 
          else. To work out how we should define our function, let's first begin by working out what our 
          parser will do on certain inputs. We'll stick with the "pChar 'a'" example for now. If 
          I give you the input "abcd", then I want you to success parse the 'a' and leave the rest, 
          ie. Just ('a', "bcd"). What if I instead give you the input "dcba" ? Well, this should fail ! 
          As far as "pChar 'a'" is concerned, it expected an 'a' and it got a 'd', hence it's failed its 
          job and must return "Nothing". At this point, you should have a plan in your head on how to 
          define this parser - we're going to pattern match on the first character and see if it 
          is what we expect.
          <pre>
    pChar :: Char -> Parser Char
    pChar a = Parser f
      where 
        f (c : cs) 
          | c == a    = Just (c, cs)
          | otherwise = Nothing 
        f [] 
          = Nothing</pre>
          <p>
            There's other ways to define this. If you thing this helper function is a bit clunky, 
            the we can instead use:
          </p>
          <pre>
    pChar :: Char -> Parser Char
    pChar a = Parser (\inp -> 
      case inp of 
        c:cs -> if c == a then Just (c, cs) else Nothing 
        []   -> Nothing )</pre>
          <p>
            Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so I'll let you decide which one you prefer - I think
            they're both nice.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might wonder why we don't just return Just ('', "dcba") in the second case. The problem 
            with this is that it gives the illusion of success, if we were to return a Just in this case,
            this it makes it seem like the parser successful acquired the character it was made to parse, 
            but this is clearly not the case - hence it's more representative to return Nothing - more 
            convincing arguments will come soon, but hopefully this quenches any doubt for now.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's try our parser ! 
          </p>
          <pre>
    > runParser (pChar 'a') "asdf"
    Just ('a', "sdf")
    > runParser (pChar 'b') "asdf"
    Nothing</pre>
        <p>
          It works ! It's a bit boring parsing just a single character though, I want to parse an entire 
          sequence of characters.
        </p>

          Now that we've got a little bit of experience under our belts, 
          we should have a suspicious about what <code>pString</code>
          will do. Given a string, <code>pString</code> should create a parser 
          that will parser that string - exactly like <code>pChar</code>. So 
          our type looks like 
        </p>
        <pre>
    pString :: String -> Parser String      </pre>
        <p>
          This parser is going to be the boss battle for this chapter, so let's plan our course of attack 
          before we even attempt to code. If I have the parser <code>pString "he"</code> and I give it the 
          input "hello", I expect the result to be <code>Just ("he", "llo")</code>. I advice you to have 
          a little meditation on how you would approach this before reading on - but do not worry if you 
          haven't got any ideas just yet, this is quite a bit harder than our first parser.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wisdom of this parser comes from the observations that if we can successful parse the first 
          character of "hello" using our parser from before, then this reduces to parsing the input "ello"
          with the parser <code>pString "e"</code>, and then finally we have to parse the input "llo", with 
          the parser <code>pString ""</code>, but this is easy ! The final parser just attempts to pass 
          an empty string, and that succeeds just by doing nothing - it just parses the first 0 characters...
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps this is slightly easier said than done though. But at least now we're ready to create 
          an actionable battle plan. Like we did in <code>pChar</code>, we're going to need a helper 
          function which will do all of the work - let's call it <code>pString'</code>, it's going to keep track of what part of the 
          parse string it hasn't parsed yet, and what's remaining of the input string. I worry this 
          might start to get a bit confusing, so let's bullet point what we expect to happen if we 
          run <code>runParser (pString "he") "hello"</code>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We're going to call the helper function with <code>pString' "he" "hello"</code></li>
          <li>Then we will try and parse "hello" with the first character of "he" -
            this is exactly what <code>pChar 'h'</code> does. If it is successful, then we will try to 
            parse "ello" with "e" - this is <code>pString' "e" "ello"</code>. If it is a failure,
            then we just return Nothing because we were unsuccess it parsing the entire string.
          </li>
          <li>Our base case will be <code>pString' "" cs</code>, in which case we can return whatever 
            we expect pString to return in the case of a success - in this case it'll be <code>Just ("he", "llo")</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Hopefully now you can visualise what this function is going to look like. If it's still not clear,
          have a little glimpse over the solution that I give and then try and implement it yourself - sometimes 
          the best way to see how someone got a particular solution is to try and solve the problem yourself 
          to get an idea of why some things do and don't work.
        </p>
  
        <pre>
    pString :: String -> Parser String
    pString str = Parser (pString' str)
      where 
        pString' :: String -> String -> Maybe (String, String)
        pString' (c : cs) inp
          = case (runParser (pChar c) inp) of 
              Just (r, rest) -> pString' cs rest
              Nothing        -> Nothing 
        pString' [] inp 
          = Just (str, inp)</pre>
        <p>
          Let's give it a little try ! 
        </p>
        <pre>
    > runParser (pString "hello") "hello"
    Just ("hello", "")
    > runParser (pString "hello") "ello"
    Nothing
    > runParser (pString "hello") "hello there!"
    Just ("hello", " there!")</pre>
        <p>
          We've beat the first boss ! One small secret I kept from you is that there 
          is a much better way to define both of these functions - but we're going to need 
          to collect a lot more tools on our journey before we can attempt to improve these implementations.
          This chapter serves as a little introduction to the idea of a parser - but the title of this 
          series is parser <i>combinators</i>. This is merely the surface of what we can do in Haskell
          with parsers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll end with a little trailer of what's to come - Haskell adopts a lot of 
          concepts from category theory, especially a lot of the mathematical structures. We're 
          going to give our parsers more structure so we can combine and transform parsers. From 
          this we'll be able to define more and more complex parsers by simply combining small 
          parsers in fun ways. I hope you enjoyed this little tutorial and I hope that you take it 
          further because we're going to see some really beautiful functional programming.
