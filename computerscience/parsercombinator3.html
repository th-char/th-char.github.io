        <p>
          We have everything we need to start build all the parsers we could possibly want.
          This is where is gets exciting so I wont spend any time giving an introduction today
          and we can just jump straight into it. The things covered in this chapter
          were mostly led by looking at the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec">Parsec Hackage docs</a>
          and choosing the parsers that I thought were important.
        </p>
        <p>
          For motivation, I thought it would be fun if we tried to construct parsers for an actual grammar.
          I decided to go with a grammar that defines a calculator. In a sort of adapted EBNF, here it is
        </p>
        <pre>
  SimpleExp := Num | '(' Exp ')'
  Exp       := SimpleExp | UnOpExpr | BinOpExpr | FuncApp
  UnOpExpr  := '-' SimpleExp
             | 'sin' SimpleExp 
             | 'cos' SimpleExp 
             | 'tan' SimpleExp
  BinOpExpr := Exp + Exp  -- lowest precedence
             | Exp - Exp 
             | Exp * Exp 
             | Exp / Exp  
             | Exp ^ Exp  -- highest precedence
  FuncDef   := Ident '(' [Var {', ' Var}] ')' '=' Exp
  Var       := Ident
  FuncApp   := Ident '(' [Exp {, Exp}] ')'
  Ident     := String</pre>
        <p>
          So a few examples of things we would be able to write are:
        </p>
        <pre>
  f(x, y) = x + y 
  5 + Sin (5 * 3) + 3 * 7
  g(x) = x
  1 + (2 + 3) + g(4) + f(2, 3)  </pre>
        <p>
          The final thing we need is a the data types to encode this structure in Haskell
        </p>
        <!--
        <pre>
  data Expr    = Num Float 
               | VarExpr Var
               | UnOpExpr UnOp Expr 
               | BinOpExpr BinOp Expr Expr 
               | FuncApp String [Expr]
  data Var     = Var String
  data UnOp    = Negate | Sin | Cos | Tan
  data BinOp   = Add    | Sub | Mul | Div 
  data FuncDef = FuncDef String [Var] Expr</pre> -->
        <pre>
  data Expr    = Num Float 
               | Var String
               | UnOpExpr UnOp Expr 
               | BinOpExpr BinOp Expr Expr 
               | FuncApp String [Expr]
  data UnOp    = Negate | Sin | Cos | Tan
  data BinOp   = Add    | Sub | Mul | Div | Exp
  data FuncDef = FuncDef String [String] Expr
</pre>
        <p>
          Now we are ready to start, I'm going to try and explain the theory behind these parsers,
          but I will try and motivate it by specific examples in our calculator language.
        </p>

        <h5>satisfy</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          To begin, we will implement what could arguably be described as one of the most
          fundemental parsers. It is <code>satisfy :: (Char -> Bool) -> Parser Char</code>
          which takes a function and successfully parsers the first character of the input only
          if the function returns <code>True</code> when applied to that function. From the first
          chapter, we should already be able to do this.
        </p>
        <pre>
  satisfy f = Parser $ \inp -> 
    case inp of 
      c:cs -> if f c then Just (c, cs) else Nothing 
      _    -> Nothing  </pre>
        <p>
          If your memory is good, you might realise that this looks very similar to <code>pChar</code>,
          and in fact we can now redefine it!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>pChar (again)</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Now that we have <code>satisfy</code>, it means that <code>pChar</code> is trivial. This
          is the fundemental idea of parser combinators: we gradually add complexity to small parsers
          to create incredibly complex parsers.
        </p>
        <pre>
  pChar :: Char -> Parser Char
  pChar c = satisfy (c==)</pre>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>pString (again)</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          This one is going to be a bit more complex, but I want to use it as an oppotunity to
          show off all of the work that we did last chapter. We're going to follow the same sort
          of structure as before, where we parsed each character of the string sequentially. So
          let's consider the base case <code>pString ""</code>, this is just a parser that parses
          no input and returns <code>""</code>. Fortunately though, that sounds suspiciously like
          <code>pure ""</code>, so we're done with the base case!
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we need to work out what <code>pString (c:cs)</code> should do. The idea now is that
          we're going to create a parser for <code>c</code> and then combine that with the parser
          for <code>cs</code>. I think for this one it's best if I write it out first and then
          explain afterwards, so
        </p>
        <pre>
  pString :: String -> Parser String 
  pString ""     = pure ""
  pString (c:cs) = (:) <$> pChar c <*> pString cs</pre>
        <p>
          The base case should already be clear. For the recursive case, let's assume that <code>pString cs</code>
          does exactly what we expect, which is return a parser that parses exactly the string <code>cs</code>,
          then we also have <code>pChar c</code>. All we need now is some way to combine the two parsers...
          The logic here is that if we try and parse some input string "combinator"
          to <code>pString "combin"</code>, then <code>pChar "c"</code> will return <code>Just ('c', "ombinator")</code>
          and
          then <code>pString "ombin"</code> will return <code>Just ("ombin", "ator")</code>. So combining these two
          parsers
          should correspond to appending "c" to "ombin", ie. <code>(:)</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still it may not be clear, so first let's consider what <code>(:) <$> pChar c</code> does. By our definition
          of
          <code>fmap</code>, we apply the function to the parsed result of the parser, so in this case, we will now have
          the result <code>Just ('c' :, "ombinator")</code>. By looking at the types of each of these functions, make
          sure
          your confident with the fact that
        </p>
        <pre>
  (:) <$> pChar c :: Parser (String -> String)
  pString cs      :: Parser String </pre>
        <p>
          Now, it should be quite easy to see just from the types that we need to use <code><*></code>. This is a design
          pattern that you will get used to. If you have a function of two parameters that you need to apply to the
          values
          contained inside two applicatives, then this pattern of <code>f <$> app1 <*> app2</code> is generally what
          you'd want to use - we're going to use this a lot more
          so we will have plenty more practise. I think this parser is much more elegant than our original one, and we
          didn't have to write any low level logic, all we have to do now is consider what our parsers should parser and
          how we have to combine the results.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>Sidenote: <code><:></code></h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          A small sidenote is that the <code>(:) <$> px <*> py</code> pattern can be made slightly more elegant, we do
          this
          by defining a new function.
        </p>
        <pre>
  (<:>) :: Parser a -> Parser [a] -> Parser a
  px <:> py = (:) <$> px <*> py</pre>
        <p>
          But you should be able to see that this is not a function that is specific to parsers, and we should always
          aim to
          make function types as general as possible, all we really need here is an applicative function, so we can
          rewrite this
          as
        </p>
        <pre>
  (<:>) :: Applicative f => f a -> f [a] -> f[a]
  px <:> py = (:) <$> px <*> py</pre>
        <p>
          Hence, the inductive case of our <code>pString</code> parser becomes
        </p>
        <pre>
  pString (c:cs) = pChar c <:> pString cs</pre>
        <p>
          It's cleaner than what we had before, and its an additional tool that we can use in the future - what we've
          done
          is called "lifting" - we've lifted <code>(:)</code> to an applicative context.
        </p>
      </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>pSpan</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Another really useful small parser that we will need is <code>pSpan :: (Char -> Bool) -> Parser String</code>
          It works in a similar way to the normal <code>span :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> ([a], [a])</code>. It will
          continue to parse a string as long as the predicate is satisfied, for example
        </p>
        <pre>
  runParser (pSpan isDigit) "123abc45" == Just ("123", "abc45")
  runParser (pSpan isSpace) "    abc"  == Just ("    ", "abc")
  runParser (pSpan isSpace) "abc"      == Nothing </pre>
        <p>
          You can see that what this parser does is repeatedly check if the predicate is satisfied after parsing each
          character,
          which is like repeatedly applying a <code>satisfy</code> parser until it fails. Finally we get to use our
          Alternative
          instance that we defined previously, one of the functions the Alternative class provides is <code>some</code>,
          which
          attemps to run the Alternative at least once (which in this case corresponds to successfully parsing a
          character),
          so we get
        </p>
        <pre>
  pSpan :: (Char -> Bool) -> Parser String 
  pSpan f = some (satisfy f)
  -- or pSpan = some . satisfy
        </pre>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>pVar</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Finally we are ready to parse are first part of the grammar! We are going to parse strings, but only strings
          that
          contain alphanumeric characters and underscores - however, a variable name cannot start with a number. So the
          way
          we can think about this is first we have to parse a letter or an underscore, then we can parse any
          alphanumeric
          character or an underscore.
        </p>
        <p>
          First let's construct our small parsers
        </p>
        <pre>
  pUnderscore :: Parser Char 
  pUnderscore = pChar '_'

  pAlpha :: Parser Char 
  pAlpha = satisfy isAlpha

  pAlphanumeric :: Parser Char 
  pAlphanumeric = satisfy isAlphaNum</pre>
        <p>
          First let's think how to parse any alphanumeric character or an underscore. It turns out that the answer is
          exactly
          in the question, using <code><|></code> from Alternative, we can very easily express this as
        </p>
        <pre>
  pAlphanumeric <|> pUnderscore :: Parser Char</pre>
        <p>
          After our first character, there may be more than one alphanumeric/"_" (there may also be zero), so to allow
          for parsing
          some arbitrary number of characters, we can use <code>many</code>, which is related to <code>some</code> from
          before,
          except it also succeeds if the supplied parser succeeds 0 times.
        </p>
        <pre>
  many (pAlphanumeric <|> pUnderscore) :: Parser [Char]</pre>
        <p>
          However, we need to guarantee that the first character is a alphanumeric character, and then we just combine
          that with
          the rest of the parsed string, looking at the types of <code>pAlpha</code> and
          <code>many (pAlphanumeric <|> pUnderscore)</code>,
          we can see that we simply need to cons the result of the first parser to the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final step is to wrap this all in a <code>Var</code>. The type constructor is a function, so we can simply
          fmap it into our
          result to turn <code>Parser String</code> into <code>Parser Expr</code>
        </p>
        <pre>
  pVar :: Parser Expr 
  pVar = Var <$> pAlpha <:> many (pAlphanumeric <|> pUnderscore)</pre>
        <p>
          So finally, we can parse our first part of the grammar, let's try it !
        </p>
        <pre>
  > runParser pVar "num1 = 5"
  Just (Var "num1"," = 5")
  > runParser pVar "num1_add_5 + 5"
  Just (Var "num1_add_5"," + 5")
  > runParser pVar "1num"
  Nothing</pre>
        <p>
          This is our first big success ! A lot of the other parsers will follow a similar process, we essential build
          up the grammar from
          small parsers and some intelligent combining.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>pNum</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          This has been quite a long tutorial, so I think we will do one more parser thats similar to <code>pVar</code>
          to finish off.
          So what is a float, well we can think of it as an integer that might have a decimal point and some numbers
          after the decimal point.
          Let's start with the easiest bit and do the integer part. What we want to do is just parse a contiguous
          sequence of numbers,
          which is exactly the job of <code>pSpan</code>, we do this with
        </p>
        <pre>
  span isDigit</pre>
        <p>
          Let's see how it works:
        </p>
        <pre>
  > runParser (pSpan isDigit) "12345" 
  Just ("12345","")
  > runParser (pSpan isDigit) "12345.6789"
  Just ("12345",".6789")</pre>
        <p>
          So it works for integers, but as soon as the number has a decimal place, it doesnt do what we want. So let's
          construct a parser for the non-integer part. It will start with a '.' and then be followed by some digits,
          I'll leave this one as an exercise, we will call it <code>pDecimalPart</code> for lack of a better name.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now we a have a parser for the integer part, and a parser for the decimal part, we need some way to
          combine them. What we're really looking to do is concatenate the results of both parsers. I think the
          best way to do this is to lift <code>++</code> to an applicative context, but it's almost exactly the same
          as what we did with cons, so I'll leave this as an easy exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we end up with is,
        </p>
        <pre>
  pSpan isDigit <++> pDecimalPart :: Parser String</pre>
        <p>
          However this is not exactly correct, we have lost the ability to parse numbers without a decimal. To fix this,
          we have say that if there is no decimal, we just return an empty string, the parser <code>pure ""</code>
          captures the idea of the empty string, we consume zero input and return <code>""</code>. So we can write
        </p>
        <pre>
  pSpan isDigit <++> (pDecimalPart <|> pure []) </pre>
        <p>
          The final part is to wrap this in our <code>Num</code> constructor, but we have a small problem,
          <code>Num :: Float -> Expr</code>,
          but we currently have a string, this is no problem, though we simply do
        </p>
        <pre>
  read <$> pSpan isDigit <++> (pDecimalPart <|> pure []) </pre>
        <p>
          Now we can do
        </p>
        <pre>
  pNum :: Parser Expr 
  pNum = Num <$> read <$> pSpan isDigit <++> (pDecimalPart <|> pure []) </pre>
        <p>
          or slightly better,
        </p>
        <pre>
  pNum = Num . read <$> pSpan isDigit <++> (pDecimalPart <|> pure []) </pre>
        <p>
          We can test this and see that (if you implemented <code>pDecimalPart</code> correctly) that we have another
          successful parser!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>sepBy1</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          To motivate this a bit, let's think about the expression <code>g(1, 5 + 4, x * 3)</code>. For this,
          we need to repeatedly parse expressions seperated by commas. The concept of parsing a specific piece of the
          grammar seperated by another piece of the grammar is a very common scenerio, so let's abstract it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>sepBy1 :: Parser a -> Parser b -> Parser [a] </code> is the parser that parses tokens
          from px seperated by tokens from py - note that it assumes that there is at least one token from px - eg
        </p>
        <pre>
  > runParser (sepBy1 pInt pComma) "1,23,453" 
  [1, 23, 453] 
  > runParser (sepBy1 pInt pComma) "1" 
  [1]
  > runParser (sepBy1 pInt pComma) ""
  Nothing</pre>
        <p>
          So how should we do this ? Well, generally if we have a grammar like this in EBNF form, it would be
        </p>
        <pre>
  Int {',' Int} </pre>
        <p>
          where the curly brackets represent zero or more repititions. We can use this to motivate how we construct
          the parser
        </p>
        <pre>
  sepBy1 :: Parser a -> Parser b -> Parser [a]
  sepBy1 px py = px <:> many (py *> px) </pre>
        <p>
          I've introduced a new symbol, <code>*> :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b</code>, what this essentially
          does
          is sequentially peforms <code>py</code> then <code>px</code>, but throws away the result from the first and
          just
          returns the result from the second. So using the example of <code>sepBy1 pInt pComma</code>, we parse at least
          one
          integer, and then we try to repeatedly parse: a comma, followed by an integer. In the first example, we could
          group it
          like
        </p>
        <pre>
  1    ,23    ,543</pre>
        <p>
          Hopefully from this it's more obivous why <code>sepBy1</code> works.

          The problem with using this for our function arguments is that we could have a function with
          zero arguments. This is precisly <code>sepBy</code>, it's very easy to define.
        </p>
        <pre>
  sepBy :: Parser a -> Parser b -> Parser [a]
  sepBy px py = sepBy1 px py <|> pure [] </pre>
        <p>
          This is basically the same logic as <code>sepBy1</code>, but if it fails to parse at least one
          token for <code>px</code>, it just returns an empty list (or more pedantically, it returns
          the parser that consumes no input and returns the empty list).
        </p>
        <pre>
            > runParser (sepBy1 pInt pComma) "1,23,453" 
            [1, 23, 453] 
            > runParser (sepBy1 pInt pComma) "1" 
            [1]
            > runParser (sepBy1 pInt pComma) ""
            []</pre>
        <p>
          Compare this with the results from <code>sepBy1</code>. This is also the logic behind how
          <code>some</code> and <code>many</code> are defined in the applicative class.

          Now we can easily parse our function applications. Let's assume that the rules for a function
          name follow the rules of the variable names. For this reason, let's abstract out that part of
          the logic from <code>pVar</code>, so we get
        </p>
        <pre>
  pIdent :: Parser String 
  pIdent = pAlpha <:> many (pAlphanumeric <|> pUnderscore)
  
  pVar :: Parser Expr 
  pVar = Var <$> pIdent</pre>
        <p>
          So first we parse the function name, which is exactly <code>pIndent</code>, then we expect a
          series of expressions separated by commas surrounded by brackets. Let's think about this in pieces.
          First, let's think about the comma seperated expressions. One's first instinct might be to write
        </p>
        <pre>
  sepBy pExpr (pChar ',')
          </pre>
        <p>
          But the problem is that this will fail on <code>1, 2, 3</code> because of the whitespace. So what we really
          want to do is parse whitespace where necessary between the commas. We can create a really simple whitespace
          parser \<code>ws</code>, but I'll leave this as an exercise. So we can do
        </p>
        <pre>
  sepBy pExpr (ws *> pChar ',' <* ws)</pre>
        <p>
          I've introduced another new operator <code><*</code>, this is like <code>*></code> - it sequentially executes
          the
          two actions, but it will throw away the second one instead of the first.
          So now, <code>"1, 2, 3"</code> will successfully parse as we discard the whitespace
          (note however that <code>" 1, 2, 3 "</code> doesn't, but
          we will fix that soon.) and now we can surround it with brackets using
        </p>
        <pre>
  '(' *> sepBy pExpr (ws *> pChar ',' <* ws) <* ')'</pre>
        <p>
          So we can now parse <code>"(1, 2, 3)"</code>, but the whitespace strikes again because
          <code>"( 1, 2, 3)"</code>
          will fail, so we fix this with
        </p>
        <pre>
  '(' *> ws *> sepBy pExpr (ws *> pChar ',' <* ws) <* ws <* ')'</pre>
        <p>
          Now, we are ready to parse the entire function call
        </p>
        <pre>
  pFuncApp :: Parser Expr 
  pFuncApp = FuncApp <$> pIdent <*> (pChar '(') *> ws *> args <* ws <* ws <* (pChar ')')
    where 
      args = sepBy pExpr (ws *> pChar ',' <* ws)</pre>
        <p>
          Hopefully its clear how we've combined all of these, as a hint
          <code>FuncApp :: String -> [Expr] -> Expr</code>,
          so <code>FuncApp <$> pIdent :: Parser ([Expr] -> Expr)</code> which should make it a bit easier to understand.
          This isnt the most attractive function ever, but we will introduce another parser which will improve this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's try it out a bit - we cant actually try it as it is, because we haven't defined <code>pExpr</code> yet,
          but I'll replace that with <code>pNum</code> for testing:
        </p>
        <pre>
  > runParser pFuncApp "f(1, 2, 3)"
  Just (FuncApp "f" [Num 1.0,Num 2.0,Num 3.0],"")
  > runParser pFuncApp "f()"
  Just (FuncApp "f" [],"")
        </pre>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>pFuncDef</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Fortunately, this one shares a lot of similarities with <code>pFuncApp</code>. We already have the mechanisms
          to do this. So first we want to parse an identifier, but we already have <code>pIdent</code>, then a list
          of identifiers surrounded by brackets and seperated by commas - but thats extremely similar to what we did
          in the last parser, and then we expect to parse an equals sign (that may be surrounded by whitespace),
          but this is not needed to construct our Haskell data type, so we throw away the result, and finally,
          we parse an expression on the right hand side of the equals sign.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we apply this sequential reasoning, and then chain it together with
          <code>FuncDef :: String -> [String] -> Expr -> Expr</code>,
          it should be quite intuitive
        </p>
        <pre>
  pFuncDef :: Parser FuncDef
  pFuncDef = FuncDef 
               <$> pIdent               
               <*> betweenBrackets args 
               <*  ws 
               <*  pChar '='
               <*  ws 
               <*> pExpr 
  where 
    args = sepBy pIdent (ws *> pChar ',' <* ws)</pre>
        <p>
          Hopefully at this point you're starting to get the hang of how to apply functions in an applicative context.
          As you can see, this function was actually not too difficult to implement, the work in building the smaller
          parsers and combining them together.

          I think we've covered quite a lot in this, in the next tutorial, we will finish our grammar and introduce
          slightly more complex
          parsers. Feel free to let me know how you found this tutorial, I am always looking to improve the quality of
          this website.

          As a little summary, here are the important functions that we've covered so far that are useful when parsing
          an language. In the

        sepBy1  :: Parser a -> Parser b -> Parser [a]
