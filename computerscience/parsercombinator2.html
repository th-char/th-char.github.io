        <h5>Introduction</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Hello again, this tutorial is going to cover the instances for the functor, monad and applicative 
          for parsers. Then, we can begin the action with some primitive combintors that we will be able 
          to use to construct more complex parsers soon.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as a little refresher, let's remind ourselves of the type of a parser.
        </p>
        <pre>
    Parser a :: Parser (String -> Maybe (a, String))</pre>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>The Functor Instance</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          To begin, let's implement a functor instance for our parsers. This means that we will need to create 
          a definition for <code>fmap :: (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b</code>. Essentially, if we think of 
          our parsers as structures that take strings and turn them into some value of type <code>a</code>,
          then <code>fmap</code> so apply a function to the parser output to turn the output into a value 
          of type <code>b</code>. Let's try and write this ! 
        </p>
        <pre>
    instance Functor Parser where 
      fmap (Parser p) f 
        = Parser (\inp -> case (p inp) of 
                            Just res -> Just (f res)
                            Nothing  -> Nothing) </pre>
        <p>
          Hopefully it's clear what is happening here. If our original parser succeeds, then we take the result 
          and apply <code>f</code> to it, but if the result fails, then we just return a failure. However,
          we can make this much more elegant! The <code>Maybe</code> type is already a functor itself, 
          so we can instead write 
        </p>
        <pre>
    instance Functor Parser where 
        fmap (Parser p) f = Parser (\inp -> f <$> p inp) 
        -- Note that f <$> p inp === fmap f (p inp)</pre>
        <p>
          This is very useful in itself - see the first exercise to see how this can be used 
          in practice. But the truth is that this is stepping stone to what we really want to 
          do, which is make our parsers monadic.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>The Applicative Instance</h5> 
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          To implement an applicative instance we need to implement <code>pure</code> and <code><*></code>.
          The definition for the former is not particularly complicated, the minimal definition is that 
          <code>pure x</code> is the parser that doesn't parse anything, and returns <code>x</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we want to implement <code><*> :: Parser (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b</code>. What 
          this means is that the first parser returns a function when it successfully parses, so 
          the semantics of <code><*></code> is that it creates a new parser that first parses 
          the inout to return a function, then parses the remaining input to return a value 
          of type <code>a</code>, and finally it returns a <code>Maybe (b, String)</code>
          by applying the function to the term of type <code>a</code>. Hopefully this gives an 
          intuition of how to chain these parsers together, let's first begin with a definition that 
          is functionally correct, but terribly written:
        </p>
        <pre>
    Parser a <*> Parser b 
      = Parser $ \inp -> case res of 
                     Nothing        -> Nothing 
                     Just (f, inp') -> case res' of 
                                         Nothing         -> Nothing 
                                         Just (x, inp'') -> Just (f x, inp'')
      where   
        res  = a inp  
        res' = b inp'</pre>
        <p>
          This is an extremely naive implementation, at each step we have to check if the 
          computation has failed, which leads to these nested cases. Fortunately though, 
          <code>Maybe</code> is the monad that represents the success or failure of a 
          computation, and the implementation of its monadic functions represents this,
          so we can simply use <code>do</code> notation in the context of the <code>Maybe</code>
          monad to handle the case of a failed computation at any stage in the computation,
          so putting these ideas together, along with the definition of <code>pure</code>, 
          we get
        </p>
        <pre>
    instance Applicative Parser where 
      pure x = Parser $ \input -> Just (x, inp)

      Parser p <*> Parser q
        = Parser $ inp -> do 
            (f, inp') <- p inp 
            (x, inp'') <- q inp' 
            return (f x, inp'')</pre>
        <p>
          Hopefully you can understand how this new implementation works, if not, it may be worth
          experimenting with the <code>Maybe</code> monad for a bit - essentially though, if any 
          step in the do notation returns a <code>Nothing</code>, the entire thing returns a 
          <code>Nothing</code>.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>The Monad Instance</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Fortunately, the monad instance is very similar to the applicative instance, so we don't have to 
          spend much time thinking about this one. <code>return</code> has to have the same definition as 
          <code>pure</code>, so the only thing we must worry about is the definition of 
          <code>(>>=) :: Parser a -> (a -> Parser b) -> Parser b</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the type signature of bind, we can kind of get a idea of what's going to happen. First, 
          we parse the input to get a value of type <code>a</code>, then we use that to produce a 
          <code>Parser b</code>, which we then use to parse the remaining input to produce a value of 
          type <code>b</code>. Hopefully this gives a bit of an intuition and now we can look at 
          implementation.
        </p>
        <pre>
    instance Monad Parser where 
      return = pure 
      Parser a >>= f 
        = Parser $ \inp -> do 
            (x, inp') <- a inp 
            let Parser b = f x
            (y, inp'') <- b inp' 
            return (y, inp'') </pre>
        <p>
          It's worth taking some time meditating on this to fully understand what's going on, but we 
          use the monadic context of <code>Maybe</code> to catch failed computations like we did 
          when we implemented the applicative instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the most part, we want to use applicatives as much as possible as they give a static 
          program structure, but monadic parsers allow us to perform branching execution like 
          we would have in an if statement, look at the exercises for an example.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>The Alternative Instance</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          At this point, you are probably sick of defining instances for our parsers, but I promise 
          this is the last one. Now, what even is an Alternative ? If you've never heard of it, let's 
          ask ghci what Alternative is 
        </p>
        <pre>
  > :i Alternative
  class Applicative f => Alternative (f :: * -> *) where
  empty :: f a
  (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a
  some :: f a -> f [a]
  many :: f a -> f [a]
  {-# MINIMAL empty, (<|>) #-} </pre>
          <p>
            Okay, so there's quite a bit going on here. If you search up alternatives in the  
            <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Control-Applicative.html#t:Alternative">Hackage documentation</a>,
            it says that an Alternative is "a monoid on applicative functors." At this point, 
            the algebraist is very happy, but for the non-algebraist, let's take a look at this functions 
            and try to understand what's happening. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A way to get an intuition for what's going on (although not the true mathematical way to 
            understand the motivation behind the structure - but such is the way of Haskell, see monads...)
            is to think of Alternative as defining a choice scheme for a type. <code>empty</code> refers 
            to making no choice at all (the "nothing choice" probably captures the concept better),
            and <code><|></code> refers to picking between two things, although generally we can see it 
            as we try to pick the first argument, unless it returns a bad choice (what exactly a bad 
            choice is depends on the implementation).
          </p>
          <p>
            I think to understand this it would be useful to look at how Alternative is defined for 
            <code>Maybe</code>. First, the nothing choice is very obviously <code>Nothing</code>,
            and then 
          </p>
          <pre>
  Just a  <|> _ = Just a 
  Nothing <|> x = x  </pre>
          <p>
            So if the first choice is good, we pick that, otherwise we just choose whatever the second 
            choice is - so if both a "bad" choices, then we return <code>Nothing</code>. 
            However, we also have functions called <code>some</code> and <code>many</code>. They 
            are both very similar: <code>many f</code> keeps running <code>f</code> until it fails
            (ie zero or more times),
            and <code>some f</code> tries to run <code>f</code> one or more times. I think it's a 
            bit hard to understand with <code>Maybe</code>, but it's very clear with our parsers,
            so we will go into more detail after we implement Alternative for our parsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "nothing choice" in the context of parsers is the parser that always fails. Making a 
            choice between two parsers corresponds to trying to parse the input with the first parser, 
            and if that fails, trying with the second parser. What this looks like in code is 
          </p>
          <pre>
  instance Alternatice Parser where 
    empty = Parser $ \inp -> Nothing 
    Parser p <|> Parser q 
      = Parser $ \inp -> case p inp of 
                           Just (x, inp) -> Just (x, inp)
                           Nothing       -> q inp  </pre>
          <p>
            I wrote this implementation with the intention of being expressive, we can write a much 
            prettier implementation though - the main improvement coming from the fact that <code>Maybe</code>
            is already alternative so this pattern match is unneeded.
          </p>
          <pre>
  instance Alternatice Parser where 
    empty = Parser $ const Nothing
    Parser p <|> Parser q = Parser $ \inp -> p inp <|> q inp</pre>
          <p>
            This is much more elegant, the good thing here is that we now have the ability to 
            choose between parsers. We also now have <code>many</code> and <code>some</code>,
            so <code>many p</code> creates a new parser that will repeatedly try and 
            apply the parser <code>p</code> until it fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of our parsers, the usefulness of alternatives are very intuitive, suppose we have a grammar like 
          </p>
          <pre>
  Instruction := "Up" | "Down"</pre>
          <p>
            What this means is that an instruction can be <code>"Up"</code> <i>or</i> <code>"Down"</code>. 
            We can encode the choice between the two options very simply, it would just be
          <pre>
  pInstruction = pUp <|> pDown</pre>
          <p>
            So as you might imagine, this is going to be ubiqutous throughout our entire parsing journey.
          </p>
