          When we discussed monads, we talked a lot about sequential composition, the concept of ordered 
          computation is actually intrinsic in the type of bind. If we look at 
        </p>
        <pre>
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b </pre>
        <p>
          then we have to perform the effects of the <code>m a</code> in order to get the <code>a</code>
          which we can then apply to the second argument which takes an <code>a</code> as a parameter
          and returns an <code>m b</code> which in turn has its own effects. The point is that the 
          effects of the <code>m a</code> must come strictly before the effects of the <code>m b</code>,
          but both have to be performed to get the final result.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, the philosophers in the crowd wonder why we must bound our thinking by the shackles 
          of time, and rightly so. There is another typeclass known as applicatives that don't impose an 
          ordering on the order of effects. To try and convince you of this, look at the type of the following 
          function defined on applicatives
        </p>
        <pre>
    <**> :: m a -> m (a -> b) -> m b </pre>
        <p>
          It looks extremely similar to <code>>>=</code>, the difference is that the entirity of the function
          that is the second argument is wrapped in some context. This means that we can evaluate the effects 
          of <code>m (a -> b)</code>
          independently of <code>m a</code> to retrieve the function with type <code>a -> b</code>, but 
          at some point we have to evaluate both computations in order to produce the final result of type 
          <code>m b</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applicatives are very similar to monads, the key difference is that they don't impose an 
          ordering on the effects. It turns out actually that applicatives are a superclass of 
          monads, every monad is also an applicative (but not vice versa). In a way, applicatives 
          are more general than monads. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The independence of effects means that the structure of applicative style programs is fixed,
          in comparison, monads allow for branching depending on the effects of previous computations.
          A result of the static programming of applicatives, the behaviour of code is known at 
          compile time and this allows for much more optimisation - in contrast, the execution path 
          of monadic computations is not known until runtime - hence it is generally better to use 
          applicatives where possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what do we need to create an applicative. The minimal definitions required - from which 
          we can define everything else - are <code>pure</code> and <code><*></code> (which is 
          the same as <code><**></code>, but with arguments reversed). <code>pure</code> is essentially 
          the same as <code>return</code> from the monad interface - this is just an artifict from 
          the development of Haskell.
