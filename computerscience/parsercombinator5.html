          Today we reach our final boss: the precedence parser. This is going to hopefully bring 
          together all of the knowledge we have gathered so far and combine all of our expression 
          parsers so that we can parse expressions with a variety of operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a copy of our grammar and its Haskell encoding.

        <h5>Motivation</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Consider the following expression 
        </p>
        <pre>
  1 * 2 + 3 ^ 4 / 5</pre>
        <p>
          It raises the question of how should we evaluate it? There are many options, for example:
        </p>
        <pre>
  1 * (2 + (3 ^ (4 / 5)))
  (((1 * 2) + 3) ^ 4) / 5
  1 * (((2 + 3) ^ 4) / 5) </pre>
        <p>
          to name a few, but I propose that the correct version is:
        </p>
        <pre>
  (1 * 2) + ((3 ^ 4) / 5) </pre>
        <p>
          As addition has the lowest precedence in this and exponention has the highest precedence.
          Another example is the expression
        </p>
        <pre>
  - 1 + sin 0.5 + 3</pre>
        <p>
          which should be evaluated as 
        </p>
        <pre>
  ((- 1) + (sin 0.5)) + 3</pre>
        <p>
          as unary operations should have the highest precedence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The precedence of operators vastly changes how the AST will be constructed when we parse 
          a given string, so we need some way to encode the precedence. The idea is that we will 
          keep a list of all of the unary and binary operations and the higher in the list an operation 
          is, the higher its precedence. For example, all of the unary operations will be first, then 
          exponentiation, then division and multiplication, then subtractions and addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important thing is the associativity of a binary operation, for example, 
        </p>
        <pre>
  1 + 2 + 3 - 4</pre>
        <p>
          should be evaluated as 
        </p>
        <pre>
  ((1 + 2) + 3) - 4 </pre>
        <p>
          There isn't any difference in the precedence of addition and subtraction, they are just 
          evaluated so that they are left associative operations, hence, in our precedence list,
          they should be at the same level (the same is true for multiplcation and division).
          So this leads us to change our precedence list to 
          be a 2D list that contains levels of operators with the same associativity and the 
          level of a group of operators represents their precedence so that all operators in 
          a group have the same precedence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think this is enough describing. Let's actually try and write some code of our ideas.
          First let's begin with the groups of operators with the same precedence. We've already 
          seen how this can be the case with binary operations with the same associativity (i.e. + and -),
          but another case is unary operators (they should all have the same highest precedence).
          So we can form the following type:
        </p>
        <pre>
  data Level a
    = BinOpL [Parser (a -> a -> a)]
    | BinOpR [Parser (a -> a -> a)]
    | Unary  [Parser (a -> a)]</pre>
        <p>
          Here we have encoded the concept of a level of precedence, now we can actually create our 
          precedence list:
        </p>
        <pre>
  precedenceTable :: [Level Expr]
  precedenceTable 
    = [ Unary  [ pNegate 
               , pSin 
               , pCos 
               , pTan    ]
      , BinOpR [ pExp    ]
      , BinOpL [ pMul               
               , pDiv    ]
      , BinOpL [ pAdd               
               , pSub    ] ] </pre>
        <p>
          Now that we have this, we need some parser that can actually utilise this information and 
          parse an expression with the correct precedence and associativity. 
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>The Level Parsers</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Let's start small 
          with this though and begin by making a parser that can parse a specific precedence level.
          Specifically, we want to create a parser
        </p>
        <pre>
  pLevel :: Parser a -> Level a -> Parser a
  pLevel atom level = ??? </pre>
        <p>
          The first thing to note is that the way we parse will depend on what we are parsing, so 
          let's pattern match on <code>level</code>. First we will try and parse a group of 
          left associative operators, 
        </p>
        <pre>
  pLevel atom (BinOpL ops) = ??? </pre>
        <p>
          So <code>ops :: [Parser (a -> a -> a)]</code>, and the intention is that we will successively 
          parse atoms (which in our case is a number) seperated by a <code>op</code> in <code>ops</code>
          and combine the expression such that the resulting AST is left associative. So for example, 
          we should get
        </p>
        <pre>
  > runParser (pNum (BinOpL [pAdd, pSub])) "1+2-3+4" 
  ((1 + 2) - 3) + 4</pre>
        <p>
          You might notice now that this seems suspiciously like <code>chainl1</code>, so let's use that 
          to our advantage. Before though, we were only able to parse a single left associative binary 
          operator, we need some way to combine all of the possible operators into one parser that 
          represents choice between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our <code>choice</code> parser should take a list of parsers and combine into one 
          parser where we successively try each parser until we find one that works. This sounds 
          quite ripe for using alternatives, specifically <code>p1 <|> p2 <|> p3</code> will 
          try <code>p1</code> first, then if that fails, it will try <code>p2</code>, 
          then if that fails, <code>p3</code>. This is the choice between <code>p1</code>,
          <code>p2</code> and <code>p3</code>.
           This can be implemented either via recursion or 
          as a fold, but I will leave this as an exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          So with this new combinator, we can write
        </p>
        <pre>
  pLevel atom (BinOpL ops) = chainl1 atom (choice ops) </pre>
        <p>
          The exact same logic holds for right associative operations, and we get
        </p>
        <pre>
          pLevel atom (BinOpR ops) = chainr1 atom (choice ops) </pre>
        <p>
          The final thing we need to do is
        </p>
        <pre>
  pLevel atom (Unary ops) = ???</pre>
        <p>
          This one requires slightly more work, because it doesnt follow the same logic as the other two,
          instead of atoms seperated by operators, what we are expecting is a chain of operators 
          proceeding an atom, for example
        </p>
        <pre>
  sin cos sin - 5 ==> sin (cos (sin (-5)))</pre>
        <p>
          This time we need a parser that will parse a chain of operators that is followed by an atom,
          which we will call <code>chainPre :: Parser (a -> a) -> Parser a -> Parser a</code>, so 
          let's take a quick detour and implement it.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>chainPre</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Succintly put, <code>chainPre op p</code> returns zero or more instances of <code>op</code>
          followed by one instance of <code>p</code>. First, we will begin with a bit of a naive 
          recursive, monadic solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially the idea is that we can parse one <code>op</code> and then recursively call 
          <code>chainPre op p</code> to parse the rest of the expression, and then compose the 
          operator with the expression, i.e.
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainPre :: Parser (a -> a) -> Parser a
  chainPre op p = rest <|> p 
    where 
      rest = do 
        f   <- op 
        exp <- chainPre op p
        return (f exp) </pre>
        <p>
          Hopefully it's clear how this works, if not, I advise you to step through it with a simple 
          example, I extract the <code>rest</code> function just for the sake of clarity, and the <code><|> p</code>
          deals with the base case when there are no more unary operators.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this is a bit clunky and we can definitely do better using combinators, specifically <code>many</code>
          where <code>many op</code> will return to us a list of the unary operators it was able to parse and then we 
          must parse an atom, so our idea is:
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainPre = do 
    fs <- many op
    x  <- p 
    return ??? </pre>
        <p>
          The question now is how do we combine the list of functions with the term. Let's consider a concrete 
          example:
        </p>
        <pre>
  String: "sin cos sin - 5"
  fs:     [Sin, Cos, Sin, Negate]
  x:      Num 5</pre>
        <p>
          What we want to produce is
        </p>
        <pre>
          Sin (Cos (Sin (Negate (Num 5)))) </pre>
        <p>
          It is possible to write the desired function as an explicit recursion, ie
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainPreHelper :: a -> [a -> a] -> a
  chainPreHelper atom []       = atom 
  chainPreHelper atom (f : fs) = f $ chainPreHelper atom fs</pre>
        <p>
          However, we can do a bit better than this. This looks suspiciously like a fold, with 
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainPreHelper atom fs = foldr ??? atom fs</pre>
        <p>
          The question is what is the the function we are folding with. Well if we look at our original 
          implementation of <code>chainPreHelper</code>, we use <code>($)</code> to combine a function 
          with a value, so this leads us to write
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainPreHelper atom fs = foldr ($) atom fs</pre>
        <p>
          So finally we get our slightly improved version of <code>chainPre</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
  chainPre = do 
    fs <- many op
    x  <- p 
    return $ foldr ($) x fs </pre>
        <p>
          However, as always, we want to try and avoid monadic functions in favour for applicative ones, 
          but the reason we rewrote <code>chainPre</code> is that it's much more ripe to create an 
          applicative function with this logic. We first parse <code>many op</code> and then 
          <code>p</code> like before, but now we need to be a bit more intelligent with how we apply 
          the <code>foldr ($) :: a -> [a] -> a</code>. As we are parsing <code>many op</code> first, 
          it makes sense to consider <code>flip (foldr ($)) :: [a] -> a -> a</code>. So now,
          we can just do
        </p>
        <pre>
          chainPre op p = flip (foldr ($)) <$> many op <*> p
        </pre>
        <p>
          and that is all there is to it! So we can now do
        </p>
        <pre>
  > runParser (chainPre pSin pNum) "sin sin sin 4"
  Just (UnOpExpr Sin (UnOpExpr Sin (UnOpExpr Sin (Num 4.0))),"")</pre>
        <p>
          So now we are ready to finish up <code>pLevel</code>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>Back to pLevel</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          Now that we have <code>chainPre</code>, we can do the case of when the level is a group 
          of unary operators, and in a similar way to the binary operator cases, we end up with
        </p>
        <pre>
  pLevel :: Parser a -> Level a -> Parser a 
  pLevel atom (BinOpL ops) = chainl1 atom (choice ops)
  pLevel atom (BinOpR ops) = chainr1 atom (choice ops)
  pLevel atom (Unary  ops) = chainPre (choice ops) atom</pre>
        <p>
          and now we can test this with our example from before!
        </p>
        <pre>
  >runParser (pLevel pNum (BinOpL [pAdd, pSub])) "1+2-3+4"
  Just (BinOpExpr Add (BinOpExpr Sub (BinOpExpr Add (Num 1.0) 
                                                    (Num 2.0)) 
                                      (Num 3.0)) 
                      (Num 4.0),"")</pre>
        <p>
          It works! So now all there is left to do is to incorporate this with our 
          precedence table.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="three columns">
        <h5>The Precedence Table</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <p>
          We are ready to tackle our final parser!
        </p>
        <pre>
  precedence :: [Level s a] -> Parser a -> Parser a
  precedence levels atom = ???</pre>
        <p>
          Let's now think about how to approach this. We will use a similar trick to encoding precedence 
          with EBNF, ie:
        </p>
        <pre>
          exp    := exp + exp | term 
          term   := term * term | factor
          factor := ( exp ) | number</pre>
        <p>
          So basically this ensures that multiplication has a higher precedence than addition.
          In a similar way we will use high precedence operations as the atom for lower precedence 
          operations. For example, we will  
        </p>
        <pre>
  pUnary  = pLevel pNum    (Unary [pNegate, pSin, pCos, pTan])
  pExp'   = pLevel pUnary  (BinaryOpR [pExp])
  pMulDiv = pLevel pExp'   (BinaryOpL [pMul, pDiv])
  pAddSub = pLevel pMulDiv (BinaryOpL [pAdd, pSub])
  pExpr   = pAddSub</pre>
        <p>
          Now you might notice that this is secretly a fold over our precedence table, so we end 
          up with the parser
        </p>
        <pre>
  precedence :: [Level a] -> Parser a -> Parser a
  precedence levels atom = foldl pLevel atom levels</pre>
        <p>
          Note that we could change the <code>foldl</code> into a <code>foldl'</code> for performance 
          benefits, but this is a bit beyond the scope of what we want to do - but I recommend 
          reading about <code>foldl'</code> nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're actually almost completely finished with all the parsers we need to parse the grammar 
          one thing from the grammar that we are missing is <code>pSimpleExpr</code>, so let's do that very quickly - 
          it's quite straightforward, we just define it by following the grammar.
        </p>
        <pre>
  pSimpleExpr :: Parser Expr
  pSimpleExpr = ws *> (betweenBrackets pExpr <|> pNum <|> pFuncApp) <* ws</pre>
        <p>
          We don't actually have <code>pExpr</code> defined yet, but we define it to be mutually recursive 
          with <code>pSimpleExpr</code> (which is the smallest atom in expressions), so we end up with

          and finally, we are done! Let's run some complex examples: (note that I wrote some show 
          instances for the expressions just so that they are easier to read).
        </p>
        <pre>
  > runParser pExpr "1 + (2 + 3) + g(4) + f(2, 3)"
  Just ((((1.0 + (2.0 + 3.0)) + g(4.0)) + f(2.0, 3.0)),"")

  > runParser pExpr "5 + sin (5 * 3) + 3 * -7"
  Just (((5.0 + (sin(5.0 * 3.0))) + (3.0 * (-7.0))),"")</pre>
        <p>
          So it looks like it all works well!

          This is probably the most complex combination of parsers we're going to come across for the 
          time being. We've successfully made parsers that can parse all parts of our grammar, 
          namely <code>pExpr</code>, <code>pFuncDef</code>. Currently we do not have the ability 
          to combine these two parsers into one parser, and in the next tutorial I will explain why,
          and various ways to fix it.
