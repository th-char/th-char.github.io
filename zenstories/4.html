                Once upon a time, there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That 
                evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, 
                “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most 
                unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came 
                back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening 
                everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great 
                turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, 
                “Maybe.” 
              </p>
              <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while 
                riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, 
                “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.” The 
                next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people 
                into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken 
                leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!”
                 Again, he said, “Maybe.”
