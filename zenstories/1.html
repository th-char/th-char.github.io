        <p>A priest was in charge of the garden within a famous Zen temple. 
            He had been given the job because he loved the flowers, shrubs, and 
            trees. Next to the temple there was another, smaller temple where 
            there lived a very old Zen master. One day, when the priest was 
            expecting some special guests, he took extra care in tending to the 
            garden. He pulled the weeds, trimmed the shrubs, combed the moss, 
            and spent a long time meticulously raking up and carefully arranging 
            all the dry autumn leaves. As he worked, the old master watched him 
            with interest from across the wall that separated the temples. </p>
          <p>
            When he had finished, the priest stood back to admire his work. 
            "Isn't it beautiful," he called out to the old master. "Yes," 
            replied the old man, "but there is something missing. Help me over 
            this wall and I'll put it right for you." </p>  
          <p>
            After hesitating, the priest lifted the old fellow over and set him 
            down. Slowly, the master walked to the tree near the center of the 
            garden, grabbed it by the trunk, and shook it. Leaves showered down 
            all over the garden. "There," said the old man, "you can put me back 
            now."
