    <p>One of master Gasan's monks visited the university in Tokyo. When he
      returned, he asked the master if he had ever read the Christian
      Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Gasan replied, "Please read some of it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk opened the Bible to the Sermon on the Mount in St. Matthew,
      and began reading. After reading Christ's words about the lilies in
      the field, he paused. Master Gasan was silent for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he finally said, "Whoever uttered these words is an
      enlightened being. What you have read to me is the essence of
      everything I have been trying to teach you here!"
