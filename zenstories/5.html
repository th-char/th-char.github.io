        <div class="twelve columns">
            <p>
                There was once a woodcutter working in the forest, chopping down
                trees. Suddenly, he noticed a hare across a clearing watching him,
                and he thought, "I am going to catch that animal and eat it for 
                lunch." But the hare could read his thoughts, and said, "you think
                you're going to catch me, don't you?" The woodcutter charged at the 
                hare, but it disappeared immediately into the bushes.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few moments later, the hare appeared again at the opposite end of
                the clearing, laughing. "You can't catch me!" it sneered. So the 
                woodcutter devised a plan, and thought to himself, "next time I see 
                that animal, I'm going to move to the opposite side of the clearing 
                to which it appears." The animal responded, "you're thinking 
                of moving to the opposite side of the clearing to which you see me 
                appear, aren't you?"
              </p>
              <p>
                The hare kept playing back and forth with the woodcutter. For over an
                 hour, the man tried to tactically run in a variety of 
                different directions to trap the hare, all to no avail. Eventually,
                he gave up and returned to chopping trees. The animal laughed at him,
                "you've given up!" Just that moment, the axe head flew off the axe,
                and killed the hare.
